# Harvesting
Here are some guidelines for harvesting Ethiopian mustard grown in a single line:

1. Timing: Ethiopian mustard is typically harvested when the plants have reached maturity and the desired stage of development. The ideal time for harvest may vary depending on the purpose of cultivation. For leafy greens, harvesting can begin when the leaves are young and tender, usually around 30 to 45 days after sowing. For seed production, the plants are allowed to mature further until the seed pods have formed and dried.

2. Visual cues: Look for visual cues to determine when the plants are ready for harvest. For leafy greens, the leaves should be well-developed and have a vibrant green color. They should be free from significant signs of damage or disease. For seed production, the plants will develop elongated seed pods, and the pods will turn brown and dry as the seeds mature.

3. Harvesting technique: To harvest Ethiopian mustard in a single line, you can use a sharp knife or pruning shears to cut the mature leaves or seed-bearing stalks. Cut the leaves/stalks close to the base of the plant, taking care not to damage neighboring plants if they are present. If you are harvesting for seed production, allow the seed pods to dry and turn brown on the plant before cutting the stalks.

4. Post-harvest handling: After harvesting, remove any damaged or undesirable leaves or seed pods. If you are harvesting leafy greens, you can rinse them gently with water to remove any dirt or debris. Properly handle and store the harvested produce to maintain freshness and quality. For leafy greens, you can refrigerate them or use them immediately. 
# Pruning 
Pruning is not a common practice in the cultivation of Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata) in a single line. Pruning is typically associated with woody plants or crops that require shaping or training, such as fruit trees or vineyard plants.

Ethiopian mustard is primarily grown for its leaves (as leafy greens) or seeds (for oil or culinary use). In the case of leafy greens, the entire plant or individual leaves are harvested when they reach the desired size and maturity, rather than pruning specific parts of the plant.


##  What time  is best  for pruning?
Pruning is not typically a common practice for Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata) as it is primarily grown for its leaves (as leafy greens) or seeds. However, if you need to selectively remove damaged or diseased leaves or stalks, it can be done throughout the growing season as needed.

When removing individual leaves or stalks, it is generally best to do so when they show signs of damage or disease. Promptly removing such plant parts can help prevent the spread of pests or diseases and promote overall plant health.
# Crop Distance

The ideal distance between two Ethiopian mustard plants, like other leafy greens, depends on various factors such as the variety of mustard, soil fertility, available nutrients, and desired yield. However, a general guideline for spacing Ethiopian mustard plants is to maintain a distance of about 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) between plants in a row. This spacing allows the plants to have enough space for proper growth, air circulation, and access to nutrients and sunlight.

Additionally, it is common to leave around 45 to 60 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) between rows to allow for ease of cultivation, harvesting, and to prevent overcrowding. Providing adequate space between plants helps to reduce competition for resources and allows each plant to develop a healthy root system, which ultimately contributes to higher productivity.

It's important to note that these spacing recommendations can vary depending on your specific growing conditions and the specific variety of Ethiopian mustard you are cultivating. Consulting with local agricultural experts or experienced farmers in your area would provide more accurate guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
